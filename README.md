==================


This package provides a configurable hub that can handle events and map them onto event projection tables (read models).

Why?
====

When CQRS and Event Sourcing come in place, we have to deal with event projections also known as read models. In most cases a projection contains a data model prepared for a specific view and optimized for querying. To map events onto projections we use so called event denormalizers. Implementation for denormalizers is a trivial and time consuming task.

What?
====

With this project I want to minimize an effort on defining event denormalizers by providing a semantic way of doing it. I beleive it's great if I can type "On a concert created event add a new projection with a concert date and title" and a computer could translate it into a code. What do you think?

How?
====

1. Install a nuget package
--

```
Install-Package FluentProjections
```

2. Implement message handlers
--

To implement a message handler inherit from MessageHandler<_ProjectionClassName_> and define a behavior for messages that have to be projected like it's shown below:

```
/// <summary>
///    "On a concert created event add a new projection with a concert date and title"
/// </summary> 
public class ConcertMessageHandler : MessageHandler<ConcertProjection>
{
    public ConcertMessageHandler(ICreateProjectionProviders factory) : base(factory)
    {
    }

    public void Handle(ConcertCreated message) // This is a handler for ConcertCreated event
    {
        Handle(message, m => m
            .AddNew()
            .Map(x => x.Id)
            .Map(x => x.ConcertDate)
            .Map(x => x.ConcertTitle));
    }
}
```

An incoming event can be translated into a series of other objects:

```
    Handle(message, x => x
        .Translate(concert => new[]
        {
            new DefineSeat { Id = concert.Seats.First().SeatId, ... },
            new DefineSeat { Id = concert.Seats.Last().SeatId, ... }
        })
        .AddNew()
        .Map(x => x.Id)
        .Map(x => x.Location, seat => seat.SeatLocation));
```

The same class can contain multiple event handlers:
```
public class ConcertMessageHandler : MessageHandler<ConcertProjection>
{
    public ConcertMessageHandler(ICreateProjectionProviders factory) : base(factory)
    {
    }

    public void Handle(ConcertCreated message)
    {
        Handle(message, x => x
            .AddNew()
            .Map(x => x.Id)
            .Map(x => x.ConcertDate)
            .Map(x => x.ConcertTitle));
    }

    public void Handle(SeatLocationCorrected message)
    {
        Handle(message, x => x
            .Update()
            .WhenEqual(...)
            .Map(...));
    }
}
```

3. Register an implementaton for ICreateProjectionProviders in IOC container.
--

ICreateProjectionProviders is a persistence provider for projections. It reads, inserts, updates and deletes projections.

There is an implementation for sql-like databases available out of the box. It's build on top of Dapper and DapperExtensions packages. Thus it supports all the databases supported by these packages.
```
Install-Package FluentProjections.Persistence.SQL
```

Component registration for Autofac could look like this:
```
builder.Register<ICreateProjectionProviders>(x => 
        new SqlPersistenceFactory(() => new SQLiteConnection(ConnectionString))
        );
```

More examples can be found here [FluentProjections.Examples](https://github.com/corker/FluentProjections.Examples)

4. Explore extensions
--
Next to the main package you can try the following extensions:

[FluentProjections.AutoMapper](https://github.com/corker/FluentProjections.AutoMapper)
> An extension to automatically map message properties to a projection using AutoMapper package.

[FluentProjections.ValueInjecter](https://github.com/corker/FluentProjections.ValueInjecter)
> An extension to automatically map message properties to a projection using ValueInjecter package.

[FluentProjections.Persistence.SQL](https://github.com/corker/FluentProjections.Persistence.SQL)
> An extension to store projections into a relational database using Dapper and DapperExtension packages.
