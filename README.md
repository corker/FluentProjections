fluent-projections
==================

This package provides a configurable hub that can handle events and map them onto event projection tables (read models).

Why?
====

When CQRS and Event Sourcing come in place, we have to deal with event projections or read models. In most cases a projection contains a data model prepared for a specific view optimized for querying. To map events onto projections we use so called event denormalizers. An implementation for a denormalizer usually is trivial but it's time consuming and code is very similar from one denormalizer to another.

What?
====

With this project I want to minimize an effort on defining event denormalizers by providing a semantic way of doing it. I beleive it's great if I can type "On a concert created event add a new projection with a concert date and title" and a computer would translate it into a code. What do you think?

How?
====

1. Install a nuget package
--

```
Install-Package FluentProjections
```

2. Implement event denormalizers
--

To implement an event denormalizer inherit from FluentEventDenormalizer<_ProjectionClassName_> and define a behavior for events that has to be projected in a class constructor like it's shown below:

```
/// <summary>
///    "On a concert created event add a new projection with a concert date and title"
/// </summary> 
public class ConcertProjectionDenormalizer : FluentEventDenormalizer<ConcertProjection>
{
    private readonly IFluentProjectionStore _store;
    
    public ConcertProjectionDenormalizer(IFluentProjectionStore store)
    {
        _store = store;

        On<ConcertCreated>()
            .AddNew()
            .Map(projection.Id)
            .Map(projection.ConcertDate)
            .Map(projection.ConcertTitle);
    }

    public void Handle(ConcertCreated @event) // This is a handler for ConcertCreated event
    {
        Handle(@event, _store);
    }
}
```

An incoming event can be translated into a series of other objects:

```
    On<ConcertCreated>()
        .Translate(concert => new[]
        {
            new DefineSeat { Id = concert.Seats.First().SeatId, ... },
            new DefineSeat { Id = concert.Seats.Last().SeatId, ... }
        })
        .AddNew()
        .Map(projection => projection.Id)
        .Map(projection => projection.Location, seat => seat.SeatLocation);
```

The same denormalizer can contain many event handlers. Simply register all of them in a single constructor:
```
    On<ConcertCreated>()
        .Translate(...)
        .AddNew()
        .Map(...);

    On<SeatLocationCorrected>()
        .Update()
        .FilterBy(...)
        .Map(...);
```

A signle handler can be defined for all registered events in a denormalizer:

```
    public void Handle(object @event)
    {
        Handle(@event, _store);
    }
```

Finally this is an example of a statistics denormalizer. It counts a number of concerts created per month.
```
public class MonthStatisticsDenormalizer : FluentEventDenormalizer<MonthStatistics>
{
    private readonly IFluentProjectionStore _store;

    public MonthStatisticsDenormalizer(IFluentProjectionStore store)
    {
        _store = store;

        On<ConcertCreated>()
            .Save() // update a projection that matches provided key(s) or create a new one
            .Key(p => p.Year, e => e.Date.Year)
            .Key(p => p.Month, e => e.Date.Month)
            .Increment(p => p.Concerts);
    }

    public void Handle(object @event)
    {
        Handle(@event, _store);
    }
}
```

3. Implement IFluentProjectionStore<TProjection>
--

IFluentProjectionStore<TProjection> is a persistence provider for your projections. It should be able to read, insert and update projections.

If you like dapper I'd be happy to say that there is an implementation for DapperFluentProjectionStore:
```
Install-Package FluentProjections.Dapper
```

The package is fully covered with unit tests. Look into a FluentProjections.Tests project for more examples.

Happy coding!

Whatâ€™s new?
-----------

**Nov 30th, 2013**      
Based on a feedback I had to make a significant change in a codebase:
- Handler registerer removed.
- Configurer turned into a FluentEventDenormalizer that you can inherit from and register as an event handler.

**Nov 24th, 2013**      
- A codebase reorganized the way you need to reference the only root namespace.
- Save method introduced - see configuration examples above.
- AddNew method renamed to Insert so as it's more explicit.
- All methods like Insert, Update, Save, Translate are implemented as extensions - it's possible to have custom methods now.
- All methods like Map, FilterBy, Key are implemented as extensions - it's possible to have custom methods now.
- Class constraint added to TProjection in IFluentProjectionStore.

**Nov 17th, 2013**      
- A single event can be translated into a series of objects. Translated objects can be handled the same way as other events.
